## README file for the Python Example data files

Two ascii data files are provided in the directory python/data. One that has been created with the MPTRAC modeule atm_select (traj_5450.tab) and the other one has been created woth MPTRAC module met_map (map_era5_2017010817_2_2.tab).
 
With atm_select, a single trajectory has been extracted from the MPTRAC data ouput file (in our example the air parcel trajectory with the number 5450).

With met_map we created gridded output from the high resolution ERA5 data files reducing the original 0.3° resolution to a 2° resolution.
